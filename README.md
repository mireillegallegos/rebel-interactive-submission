# Progressively Enhance Me!

Get started:

1. Clone this project locally
2. Install project dependencies (`npm i`)
3. Run the project (`npm run start`)
4. Your browser will open with a preview of the site!

Edit styles in the `src/assets/styles` directory, views, if necessary, in `src/assets/views`, and the HTML for the page in `src/pages/index.md`. The file is in Markdown but you can write normal HTML in.

## Install project dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

## Run the project locally

```bash
npm run start
```
